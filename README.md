# CarRentalApp
ThisIsMySchoolProject where i have developed a WindowsApp with fully functionable backend and clean UserInterface
My uni has provided me a username and password which i have used as my primary to login keys to interact with my app and add bookings.
The Provided Username and password is given below;
username= sta001
password= givemethe keys
This app contains various features some of them are;
Greetings Customers,
Total Cost Calculaton,
DataGridView to search and view existings bookings,
WelcomePage,
Instruction Menu,
LoginPage,
Dashboard or Menu Page,
AddBooking Page, and
ViewRentalsPage.

Not Only that but it also generates Unique Booking Ids for each new Bookings and a DataGridView to with a search button to view existings bookings by their booking IDs or First or LastName.
